Scientific Programming In Real Life (SPIRL) is an introduction to core concepts for scientists to get started with programming in Python, scripting in bash, and version control with Git. The open source textbook is free and available at [cjtu.github.io/spirl](https://cjtu.github.io/spirl).

## The textbook

The SPIRL textbook is a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) that provides tutorials, and interactive code blocks to help teach practical programming concepts. For more info on how the textbook was made and to get your own template, check out [Jupyterbook](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html).

## The course

The SPIRL textbook supports a scientific programming short course run at Northern Arizona University. The syllabus for the Fall 2021 edition course can be found [here](https://cjtu.github.io/spirl/f21_about.html).
