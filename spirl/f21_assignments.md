You can check on GitHub if you pushed successfully by refreshing your forked repository page. You should see your newest changes reflected in the files on GitHub.

6) Name your pull request (e.g. "Submit Assignment 0") and leave a description if you'd like. Click "Create".

1) To check if your assignment was successfully submitted, you can check the pull requests on github at the main `cjtu/spirl-f21-assignments` repo [here](https://github.com/cjtu/spirl-f21-assignments/pulls).

8) You're done! Once your pull request appears on GitHub, your assignment is officially submitted. Nice job!

9) (optional) To fix your submission while the pull request is open simply make changes, commit and push. The pull request will be automatically updated. If the pull request is already `Merged` or `Closed`, you will need to commit and push changes and open a new pull request.

Christian or Shih-Yun will leave feedback on your pull request before the next class.
